# Library-ERM
A library manages books and journals. Each book is published by a publishing house, 
there may be several copies of each book, which can also be borrowed by customers. 
There are published issues of the journals, these are only available once, a loan 
is not possible.
The articles published in the journals as well as the books should be managed in 
such a way that comfortable functions for information retrieval are possible: In 
addition to the assignment of a subject area, there should also be a keyword, 
whereby the relevance of each assigned keyword is important. Synonymous keywords 
should be recorded. Articles and books can each have several authors. Certain books 
can each have one book as a translation template, articles can reference each other:
Each borrowing is handled by one employee, and one employee is also responsible 
for returning the book copy.
Customers can also reserve books, each reservation usually results in a loan. 
The books and magazines are stored on shelves. A journal is placed on a shelf, 
and each shelf is assigned a subject area for the storage of the books.
